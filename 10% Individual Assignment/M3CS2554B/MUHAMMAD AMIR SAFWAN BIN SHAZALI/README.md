# üîç Spike Testing of JSONPlaceHolder using Grafana k6
### üí• INTRODUCTION
 <div align="justify"> Performance testing helps determine how a system handles sudden increases in user load. In this project, I conducted a spike test using Grafana k6, a modern open-source load testing tool. The spike test measures how well a system responds to an unexpected surge of traffic in a short period of time. For this test, I used JSONPlaceholder, a free online REST API commonly used for testing and prototyping. It simulates real-world API responses without affecting a live production system. The purpose of this test is to observe how the API behaves when it suddenly receives a large number of requests ‚Äî checking for slowdowns, failed requests, or performance recovery after the spike ends. </div>

### OBJECTIVES
- To simulate a sudden spike in virtual users sending requests to the JSONPlaceholder API using Grafana k6.
- To measure the system‚Äôs response time, throughput, and error rate during and after the spike period.
- To observe how quickly the system recovers after the sudden increase in load.
- To analyze the test results and provide recommendations for improving performance and stability.
