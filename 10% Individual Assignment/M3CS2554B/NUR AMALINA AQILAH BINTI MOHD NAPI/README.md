### Tittle: Load Testing on Wikipedia using Apache JMeter

#### Introduction:
##### This performance testing was conducted using Apache JMeter to examine the speed, stability, and response of the Wikipedia website under a simulated user load. The purpose of the test is to observe the behavior of the website when several users are accessing it at the same time. A test script was created in JMeter with five virtual users, five seconds ramp-up time, and two loops to generate a total of ten requests. The test was targeted at collecting data such as average response time, throughput, and error percentage to achieve the overall performance of the website. This exercise also demonstrates how JMeter components such as Thread Group, HTTP Header Manager, HTTP Request, View Results Tree, and Summary Report are used to measure and analyze web application performance effectively.
