## **Title & Introduction**

# üîç Stress Testing of DummyJSON using Artillery

### **Introduction:**

The assignment demands Artillery execution of a stress test on DummyJSON API to evaluate its operational stability when facing high traffic volumes. The test evaluates API performance under heavy traffic conditions to detect rate limit violations that result in HTTP 429 errors and assesses its recovery time after traffic decreases. The test evaluates API scalability through performance metrics which include response time and data processing capacity and error frequency during warm-up, high load and recovery phases.

## **Objectives**

- Evaluate the **performance and stability** of Reqres.in under increasing concurrent user load.  
- Measure **response time**, **throughput**, and **error rates** as load grows.  
- Observe **rate-limiting thresholds** for write operations (POST, PUT, DELETE).  
- Assess API **resilience** and responsiveness during sustained stress.
