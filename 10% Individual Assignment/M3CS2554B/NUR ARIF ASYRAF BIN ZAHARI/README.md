# üîç Stress Testing on DummyJSON using Artillery
---

## Introduction

The assignment demands Artillery execution of a stress test on DummyJSON API to evaluate its operational stability when facing high traffic volumes. The test evaluates API performance under heavy traffic conditions to detect rate limit violations that result in HTTP 429 errors and assesses its recovery time after traffic decreases. The test evaluates API scalability through performance metrics which include response time and data processing capacity and error frequency during warm-up, high load and recovery phases.

---

## Objectives

- To evaluate the performance and stability of the DummyJSON API under different load conditions.
- To observe how the API responds during warm-up, sustained high load, and recovery phases.
- To identify potential performance bottlenecks or timeout issues under heavy traffic.
- To measure response times, throughput, and error rates for performance analysis.

## Performance Testing Tool (Artillery)

The experiment used Artillery because this open-source tool enables simple testing framework designed for HTTP, WebSocket, and API-level testing. Stress testing through YAML script execution. The tool delivers precise measurements of response times and errors while Built-in Cloud dashboard for reporting which is Artillery Cloud generates visual performance graphs for better analysis.

## Target Web Application (DummyJson)

The experiment used DummyJSON because it offers a free stable fake REST API that performs well for performance testing. The API generates realistic data about products and users which enables Artillery to perform simulations of actual API operations. The API generates stable responses which make it perfect for studying system performance and stability during high-stress situations.

## Hypothesis Application's Performance

The DummyJSON API will maintain operational stability at normal usage levels but will start to show delayed responses and HTTP 429 rate-limiting errors when handling large numbers of users. The API will experience rising latency and server throttling timeouts when request numbers exceed its maximum processing threshold. The API performance will return to normal after load reduction during the recovery phase because the system failure is not the cause of performance degradation under stress.

| **Sustained High Load Phase** | 120 seconds  | 150 users/sec                | Applies continuous heavy virtual user traffic to test the API‚Äôs stability, response time, and error handling under stress. |
| **Recovery Phase**            | 30 seconds   | 50 users/sec                 | Gradually reduces the number of virtual users to observe how the API performance stabilizes after intense usage.           |

## Performance Summary Observation

## Throughput

- Request Rate: 534 requests/sec
- Total Requests: 100,500
- Observation: High throughput shows the API can handle continuous heavy load.

## Error Rate

- HTTP 2xx Responses: 73,730 (73.4%)
- HTTP 429 Responses (Rate-Limit): 26,770 (26.7%)
- Observation: 27% of requests failed due to throttling, indicating the server limits concurrent requests under stress.

## Raw Data Presentation

<img width="1378" height="566" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb400c17-8603-4e81-abbe-ba8a2c60ff3d" />
The evaluation consisted of three distinct stages which included Warm-up followed by Sustained Load and then Recovery. The system maintained fast response times throughout the Warm-up period while the load continued to rise. The system maintained 600‚Äì900 req/s performance during the Sustained phase while keeping latency at a low level. The system restored its performance to normal levels during Recovery which demonstrated its ability to maintain stability and recover from stress.

The test system processed 100.5K requests which resulted in fast successful responses with median 23 ms response times and 95% of responses under 290 ms and a maximum response time of 2.5 seconds. The system returned 200/201 responses for 73% of requests but produced 26.7K (26.7%) rate-limit errors which indicated excellent performance with only occasional throttling during high traffic conditions.

---

## Overall Observation

- The API sustains high throughput efficiently.
- Most responses are fast, but the server triggers rate limiting under heavy load.
- Tail latency indicates some requests may experience delays at peak stress.
