Artillery is an open-source tool that facilitates a straightforward testing framework for HTTP, WebSocket, and API-level testing, it was employed in the experiment. YAML script execution for stress testing. The tool provides accurate error and reaction time measurements, and its integrated cloud dashboard for reporting is For improved analysis, Artillery Cloud creates graphic performance graphs.

## Target Web Application (Discord)

The experiment used the Discord API because it provides a reliable, developer-friendly platform with real-world scalability. The API supports both REST and WebSocket communication, allowing realistic simulations of user interactions and message exchanges. Its well-documented endpoints and stable performance make it ideal for evaluating system response times, rate limits, and stability under high user load using Artillery.

| **Number of Virtual Users (VUs)**    | 3000 created                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Test Scenario Description**        | Each virtual user sends a `GET` request to `/api/users?page=2`, simulating typical client behavior retrieving paginated user data.                               |

| **Performance Thresholds (Targets)** | - Average Response Time ‚â§ 500 ms  <br> - Error Rate ‚â§ 2%  <br> - 95% Responses < 1s                                                                              |
| **Test Environment**                 | Localhost (Windows 10, Intel i7, 16GB RAM) <br> Network: 100 Mbps broadband                                                                                      |

| **Assumptions**                      | Discord API remains accessible and stable throughout testing.                                                                                              |
| **Risks / Constraints**              | DIscord API may have rate limiting or IP blocking during extended scalability tests.                                                                                     |
| **Success Criteria**                 | API maintains <5% error rate and <500 ms mean response time under 30 requests/sec load.                                                                          |

## üìà **4. Data Analysis & Interpretation**

| Metric | Observation | Interpretation |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Response Time (mean)** | 278 ms | Acceptable for most API calls (<300 ms). |
| **p95 Response Time** | 487 ms | Indicates 95% of requests completed below 0.5s ‚Äî good stability. |
| **Errors (ECONNRESET)** | 8 | Minimal network resets due to concurrency spikes. |
| **HTTP 404 Errors** | 5984 | Suggests requests to a non-existent endpoint or query mismatch. |
| **User Completion Rate** | 2992/3000 (99.7%) | Excellent session completion rate under load. |

### üìâ Observed Bottlenecks
- 404 responses indicate the API endpoint was incorrect or rate-limited under stress.  
- Slight response latency spike at high concurrency (p99 = 889 ms).  
- Minor connection resets suggest socket timeout under heavy load.

---

## üß† **5. Recommendations**

1. **Validate endpoint configuration** ‚Äî confirm `/api/users?page=2` accepts concurrent requests.  
2. **Enable caching or CDN** to reduce backend load.  
3. **Optimize concurrency handling** ‚Äî tune Artillery‚Äôs phase ramp-up or backend throttling.  
4. **Monitor API rate-limiting** via logs or HTTP headers.  
5. **Add soak and stress tests** for extended evaluation of performance stability.

---

## üß© **6. Conclusion**

The performance test demonstrated that the target API handles moderate concurrent load effectively with an average response time below 300 ms and high completion rates. However, consistent 404 errors and occasional connection resets suggest configuration or rate-limiting issues under sustained high traffic. Future tests will explore long-duration soak tests and scaling improvements.
