# üîç Soak Testing of ChatGPT using JMeter
### üéì INTRODUCTION
Performance testing helps us understand how a website works when many people use it at the same time or for a long period. It checks if the website stays fast, stable, and reliable. For this assignment, I choose ChatGPT as the web application to test. ChatGPT is a popular AI chatbot that lets users talk to it by typing messages. I focused on a type of performance test called a Soak Test. This test checks how well the system performs when it is used continuously for a long time. It helps find problems like slow responses or crashes that might happen after hours of use. To do this test, I used Apache JMeter, a tool commonly used for performance testing. Since we are not allowed to test ChatGPT‚Äôs real servers, I created simulated results. These results show what we might expect if we tested a similar system for a long time.

### üß† OBJECTIVES
- To simulate a continuous number of virtual users interacting with the ChatGPT web interface over an extended period.

- To observe the system‚Äôs response time, throughput, and error rate.

- To identify potential memory leaks, performance degradation, or slowdowns that may appear after long usage.

- To analyze the results and give recommendations for better performance and stability.
