## Soak Testing of ChatGPT Using JMeter
### INTRODUCTION
Performance testing helps us understand how a website works when many people use it at the same time or for a long period. It checks if the website stays fast, stable, and reliable. For this assignment, I choose ChatGPT as the web application to test. ChatGPT is a popular AI chatbot that lets users talk to it by typing messages. I focused on a type of performance test called a Soak Test. This test checks how well the system performs when it is used continuously for a long time. It helps find problems like slow responses or crashes that might happen after hours of use. To do this test, I used Apache JMeter, a tool commonly used for performance testing. Since we are not allowed to test ChatGPTâ€™s real servers, I created simulated results. These results show what we might expect if we tested a similar system for a long time.
