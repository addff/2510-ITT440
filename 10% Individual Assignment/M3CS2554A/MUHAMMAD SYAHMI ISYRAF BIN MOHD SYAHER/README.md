**Class:** M3CS2554A  

**Course Code:** ITT440

## üéØ Title
This project demonstrates **Spike Testing** using **Postman** with the **Fake Store API**.  

---

## üéØ Objective
- To perform Spike Testing on an open REST API using Postman.  
- To observe how response time and success rate behave under sudden, high request volume.  
- To analyze API stability and reliability during load spikes.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tool & Target Site Selection
**Tool:** Postman  
**Target Site:** [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com)

### Why Fake Store API?
It provides dummy product, user, and cart data that is ideal for performance and reliability testing.

### Why Postman?
It supports **Collection Runner** and **Newman CLI** for automated, repeated, or concurrent test executions. It is also **easy** to use.

---

## üß™ Test Plan & Configuration
- **Test Type:** Spike Testing  
- **Request Method:** `GET`  
- **Endpoint:** `https://fakestoreapi.com/products`  
- **Test Duration:** 3 Phases  
  1. **Normal Load** ‚Äì 10 requests (baseline)  
  2. **Spike Load** ‚Äì 500 requests (sudden surge)  
  3. **Recovery Load** ‚Äì 10 requests (return to normal)
 - **Test Script**
```javascript
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response time is below 1000ms", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(1000);
});

```

### Assertions
- Verify `Status Code = 200`  
- Record **Avarage Response Time (ms)** and **Duration (s)** and **Error %**

---

## Test Scenarios
1. Send 10 GET requests under normal conditions.  
2. Rapidly send 500 GET requests to simulate a sudden spike in traffic.  
3. Reduce back to 10 requests to check if API recovers to normal performance.  
4. Log and compare average response times between phases.

---

## Results (with charts)

| Phase | Total Requests | Passed | Failed | Avg Response Time (ms) | Duration | Error % |
|--------|----------------|--------|--------|-------------------------|---------|----------|
| Normal Load | 10 | ‚úÖ 10 | ‚ùå 0 | 260 | 3s 717ms | 0.0 |
| Spike Load | 500 | ‚úÖ 497 | ‚ùå 3 | 275 | 2m 59s | 0.6 |
| Recovery | 10 | ‚úÖ 10 | ‚ùå 0 | 268 | 3s 819ms | 0.0 |

### Observations
- During the spike, average response time increased from **260 ms ‚Üí 275 ms**, as more request is being process.  
- After the spike, the API recovered to **268 ms**, indicating it is starting to stabilize.  
- Only **3 failures (timeouts)** occurred during the highest load.

## Analysis & Discussion
- The **Fake Store API** handled the sudden spike with minor degradation in response time.  
- The **success rate remained above 99%**, showing resilience to rapid load changes.  
- The **response size** remained constant, confirming data integrity.  
- **Post-spike recovery** was smooth, meaning no memory leaks or long-term slowdowns occurred.

---

## Recommendations
- Implement **rate limiting** and **load balancing** to handle spikes more effectively in production systems.  
- Use **Postman + Newman CLI** to simulate concurrent users via command line.  
- Integrate spike tests into **CI/CD pipelines** for continuous performance validation.

---

## Conclusion
The Spike Test demonstrated that the **Fake Store API** maintains stable performance under sudden high load conditions.  
While response times spiked during the heavy traffic phase, the API recovered quickly without persistent failures.  
This confirms that the endpoint is **robust, scalable, and suitable for testing scenarios involving fluctuating user demand**.
