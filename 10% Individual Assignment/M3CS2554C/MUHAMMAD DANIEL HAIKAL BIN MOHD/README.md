# 🧪 WordPress Load Test using BlazeMeter

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates a basic **load testing** process on a WordPress website using **BlazeMeter (based on Apache JMeter)**.  
The goal of this test is to analyze how a WordPress site performs under different user loads — focusing on response time, throughput, and error rate.

## ⚙️ Test Configuration

| Parameter | Details |
|------------|----------|
| **Tool Used** | BlazeMeter  |
| **Test Type** | URL Test |
| **Target Website** | [https://wp-themes.com/twentytwentyfour/](https://wp-themes.com/twentytwentyfour/) |
| **Number of Virtual Users (VU)** | 10 |
| **Test Duration** | 5 minutes |
| **Location** | Asia Southeast (Singapore, Google) |
| **Ramp-up Time** | Default (BlazeMeter handles automatically) |

---

## 🎯 Test Objectives
- Measure the average response time of the WordPress site.  
- Observe throughput (hits per second).  
- Check for any failed requests or errors during high load.  
- Analyze server behavior during multiple simultaneous connections.

## 🧠 Analysis
- The average response time stayed below **400 ms**, which indicates that the website handled 10 users efficiently.  
- There were **no errors**, showing good server stability.  
- Throughput (hits per second) remained consistent, meaning the site could sustain the simulated traffic.  
- Overall performance was **stable and responsive** under the given test conditions.

---

## 🚀 Conclusion
The BlazeMeter test results show that the selected WordPress site performs well under a moderate load of 10 virtual users.  
For future improvements, you can:
- Increase the number of users to test scalability.  
- Try running tests from multiple regions.  
- Include login or comment interactions to simulate real user behavior.
