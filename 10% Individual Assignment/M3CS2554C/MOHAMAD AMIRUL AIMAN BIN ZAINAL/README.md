## üèÜ Project Objective
This project's goal is to use Grafana K6 to assess the stability and performance of the public API https://httpbin.org.  Smoke testing was used to confirm the API's fundamental stability and responsiveness under light to moderate load, while breakpoint testing was used to progressively raise the load and determine the system's performance limit.  In order to examine how the API functions in various traffic scenarios, the project will monitor important metrics including response time, error rate, and throughput.


## üåê Target Application Description
The target application for this project is https://httpbin.org ,a free and public HTTP request and response service. It is commonly used for testing, 
debugging, and experimenting with HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The website returns data about the requests it receives, making it 
suitable for performance and API testing without affecting any real production system.


## üõ†Ô∏è Test Environment

This section details the hardware and software used to execute the performance test, ensuring the results are reproducible.

| Component | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Test Machine** | IdeaPad Gaming 3 |
| **CPU** | 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-11300H @ 3.10GHz (3.11 GHz)|
| **RAM** | 8GB DDR4 |
| **Tool** | Grafana k6 v1.3.0 |
| **Test Type** | Smoke and Breakpoint Testing |
| **Target Application URL** | 'https://httpbin.org' |


## üíª Test Plan and Configuration
| **Test Type**          | **Configuration Details**                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Smoke Test**         | 50 Virtual Users (VUs), 45-second duration. Purpose: to verify basic system stability and response under a small, short load.                                    |
| **Breakpoint Test**    | Gradual load increase from 50 to 250 VUs, 20 seconds per stage. Purpose: to identify the maximum load the application can handle before performance degradation. |
| **Request Type**       | HTTP GET requests sent to `https://httpbin.org/get`.                                                                                                             |
| **Metrics Observed**   | Response time (latency), error rate, and throughput (requests per second).                                                                                       |
| **Threshold Criteria** | 95% of requests must complete under 1.5 seconds with less than 5% failed requests.                                                                               |
| **Script Language**    | JavaScript (k6 test scripts).                                                                                                                                    |


## üíª Smoke Test Configuration
```js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

// Smoke Test Configuration
export let options = {
  vus: 50,                  
  duration: '45s',          
  thresholds: {
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.05'],    
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<1500'],
  },
};

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('https://httpbin.org/get');
  check(res, { 'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200 });
  sleep(1);
}
```

## üíª Breakpoint Test Configuration
```js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

// Breakpoint Test Configuration
export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '20s', target: 50 },   // ramp up to 50 VUs
    { duration: '20s', target: 100 },  // ramp up to 100 VUs
    { duration: '20s', target: 150 },  // ramp up to 150 VUs
    { duration: '20s', target: 200 },  // ramp up to 200 VUs
    { duration: '20s', target: 250 },  // ramp up to 250 VUs
    { duration: '20s', target: 0 },    // ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.10'],     
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<2000'],  // 
  },
};

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('https://httpbin.org/get');  

  // Check response status
  check(res, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
  });

  sleep(1); 
}
