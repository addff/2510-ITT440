# A Spike Test and Analysis of Drupal-Based Hosting Using JMeter
<div style="text-align: justify;">
There are currently many web hosting services on the internet. As of this day web hosts, such as Bluehost, Hostinger, IONOS, etc., all share one common service, which is to provide a place on a server and allocate all of the web application's files, creating an accessible storage for internet users. Although they provide the same service, the performance and vulnerability of the service play an important role for consumers to choose their preferred web host. Hence, the objective of this article is to design, execute, and analyse a performance test plan for a web application using a specialised testing tool.

## Performance Testing Tool
The tool that was used for this experiment is <b>JMeter</b>. It is an open-source testing tool from Apache that provides a wide range of performance testing capabilities. The application is Java-based and allows testing of client-server applications such as databases, FTP servers, websites, web services, etc. <b>The main interest for this study is to use JMeter and run a spike test on a local web application (demo)</b>. The tool was chosen for the benefits of:

### Server Compatibility
<div style="text-align: justify;">
JMeter is a thoroughly capable tool that can address load and performance testing for different products, ignoring the server or protocol. JMeter disregards protocols such as HTTP or HTTPS web services, databases, FTP, LDAP, MOM (message-orientated middleware) through NoSQL (MongoDB), and JMS.

### Distributed Load Testing
<div style="text-align: justify;">
JMeter supplies distributed load testing, permitting developers and testers to manipulate a master-slave set, enabling load testing on different machines.
</div>

### Customizations
<div style="text-align: justify;">
JMeter enables customization since it allows users to take advantage of its open-source nature. The customization can be related to its source code and create anything that suits users' requirements.
