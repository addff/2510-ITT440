# 🧪 Comprehensive Web Application Performance Testing & Analysis

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates a **comprehensive performance testing and analysis** process for a web application using **Apache JMeter**. The goal is to assess the system’s behavior under various loads and identify performance bottlenecks through **Load Test**, **Stress Test**, and **Spike Test** scenarios.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design and execute performance tests for a web application.  
- Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, throughput, and error rate.  
- Interpret results to identify system limitations and propose optimization strategies.

## ⚙️ Test Plan
| Test Type | Description | Goal |
|------------|-------------|------|
| **Load Test** | Simulates expected user load to measure system stability and response. | Evaluate performance under normal usage. |
| **Stress Test** | Gradually increases load until the system breaks. | Identify breaking points and system limits. |
| **Spike Test** | Applies sudden load surges. | Observe how the system handles abrupt traffic spikes. |

## 🌐 Target Web Application
*(Insert your chosen public web application here — e.g., https://example.com)*  
The selected web application was tested for response stability, throughput, and error handling under increasing load scenarios.

---

## 📊 Key Metrics
- **Average Response Time (ms)**
- **Throughput (requests/sec)**
- **Error Rate (%)**
- **CPU & Memory Utilization**

All metrics were collected from JMeter reports and analyzed to determine system efficiency and resilience.

## 📈 Results & Analysis
*(Insert your graphs, charts, or screenshots here)*

### 🔹 Load Test
> Summary of behavior under normal load.  
> *E.g., Stable response time up to 200 users; minor latency beyond that.*

### 🔹 Stress Test
> Summary of performance degradation under extreme load.  
> *E.g., System began failing at 400 users due to database timeout.*

### 🔹 Spike Test
> Summary of recovery and resilience to sudden traffic bursts.  
> *E.g., System recovered after initial spike delay of 3 seconds.*

## 💡 Insights & Recommendations
- Optimize database queries and caching mechanisms.
- Implement load balancing to distribute traffic efficiently.
- Enhance error handling for better user experience under peak conditions.
