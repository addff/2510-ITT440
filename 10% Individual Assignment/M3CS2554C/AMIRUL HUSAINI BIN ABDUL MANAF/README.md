## **INTRODUCTION TO WEB APPLICATION PERFORMANCE TESTING & ANALYSIS**
<p align="justify">
Web application testing and analysis is a process to evaluate a web application's functionality, performance, security, and usability to find defects and ensure it meets requirements before release. The goal is to identify and fix bugs to provide a seamless user experience and high-quality product, which is achieved through systematic testing and analysis across different environments like browsers and operating systems. </p>

## üí° Testing Goal

To assess the performance and stability of the DummyJSON web API under concurrent user load using Locust load testing tool.

## üß∞ Tool Selection : LOCUST

<p align="justify">
Locust is an open-source, Python-based load testing tool designed for performance testing of web applications and APIs. It allows users to define the behavior of virtual users using standard Python code, offering flexibility and extensibility compared to tools relying on graphical user interfaces or domain-specific languages. </p>

## üîë Main Features of LOCUST

- Scalability
- Python-based scripting
- Real-time monitoring

## üöÄ Test Environment Setup and Methodology.

Here, we can input these information:
- number of users
- ramp up (users started per second)
- host
- run time

## üìä Raw Data Presentation

This is the web interface of the LOCUST that is easier to run and monitor. 


## üìù Interpretation of Results and Identified Bottlenecks

### Result Summary Table
| Endpoint        | Avg Time (ms) | 95% Time (ms) | Requests/s | Failures |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| /products       |               |               |             |          |
