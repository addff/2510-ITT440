## 🛠️ Why Gatling, huh? (Tool selection justification)

I picked Gatling as my load testing tool because its modern design makes the entire performance check-up process—from generating traffic to analyzing results—more efficient and reliable.

Gatling uses a smart, **asynchronous architecture** which means it can handle **huge traffic** and simulate thousands of users using very little computer power. This allows me to run bigger, more realistic tests to find the application's true breaking limits.

The test scenarios are written as clean, **simple, and readable code** (a DSL), making them easy to update when the application changes, which also helps the team collaborate better. 

After every test, Gatling automatically generates **amazing, detailed HTML reports**. These reports give me instant insight into the results with graphs that clearly pinpoint the exact slow spots (bottlenecks) in the application. 

Finally, Gatling **fits right into my automated development process (CI/CD)**, ensuring I catch performance problems early and continuously before it ever become a serious issue.
