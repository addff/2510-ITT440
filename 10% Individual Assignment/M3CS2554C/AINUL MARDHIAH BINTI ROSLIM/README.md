## üõ†Ô∏è Why Gatling, huh? (Tool selection justification)

I picked Gatling as my load testing tool because its modern design makes the entire performance check-up process‚Äîfrom generating traffic to analyzing results‚Äîmore efficient and reliable.

Gatling uses a smart, **asynchronous architecture** which means it can handle **huge traffic** and simulate thousands of users using very little computer power. This allows me to run bigger, more realistic tests to find the application's true breaking limits.

The test scenarios are written as clean, **simple, and readable code** (a DSL), making them easy to update when the application changes, which also helps the team collaborate better. 

After every test, Gatling automatically generates **amazing, detailed HTML reports**. These reports give me instant insight into the results with graphs that clearly pinpoint the exact slow spots (bottlenecks) in the application. 

Finally, Gatling **fits right into my automated development process (CI/CD)**, ensuring I catch performance problems early and continuously before it ever become a serious issue.

## üìú Next Station, My Testing Handbook! (Methodology)

firstly we will go to **PHASE 1** where I initializing my pre - framework in my computer terminal

1.  **Write Java Code**
The coding below is my java coding that Gatling had used to make a Stimulation Load test at `https://the-internet.herokuapp.com`


1.  **Launch Gatling**
From my Computer terminal or command prompt, I had navigated to my project root
3.  **Define Goal:** Set the objective (e.g., $p95 < 2.0$ seconds).
4.  **Define Success:** Confirm the assertion: Global failed requests must be **$\le 1.0\%$**.
5.  **Launch & Select:** Run the `.\mvnw.cmd gatling:test` command and select the `CleanSimulation`.
6.  **Smoke Test:** Run a 1-user test to verify the **POST** to `/authenticate` and the **CSS check** for the "Welcome to the Secure Area" header are successful.

### Phase 2: Execution (The Test Run)

5.  **Run Official Load:** Execute the full **10 users over 60 seconds** load.
6.  **Monitor Safety:** Actively monitor your machine's resources and **STOP IMMEDIATELY** if the public application shows stress.

### Phase 3: Analysis & Conclusion (The Verdict)

7.  **Validate Success:** Check the HTML report failure rate against the **$\le 1.0\%$ assertion**.
8.  **Analyze $p95$:** Determine the overall response time quality by reviewing the **$95^{th}$ Percentile ($p95$)** for the critical request: `"T02_POST_Login_and_Access_Secure"`.
9.  **Pinpoint Bottleneck:** Compare the timings between **T01** (page load) and **T02** (login processing) to identify the slowest step.
10. **Final Report:** Document the results, stating whether the test **Passed or Failed** the established goal.
